The ISCO Job Board backend is a Node.js and Express REST API that powers a simple job posting and application platform. It uses SQLite for storage and JWT-based authentication with role support for user and admin. Users can register, log in, browse jobs, apply for positions, and track their applications, while admins have additional privileges such as posting, editing, and deleting jobs, reviewing applications, updating their statuses, and managing user accounts. The database schema includes users, jobs, and applications tables, all automatically created on first run with a seeded default admin account.

The API is organized into clear route groups: /auth handles user and admin authentication and registration, /jobs manages job listings and filtering, /applications provides application submission and tracking features, and /users covers account management. Authentication is required for protected routes, and admin-only operations are enforced via middleware. All requests and responses are JSON-based, and pagination and filtering options are available where appropriate. Tests are included via Jest and Supertest, covering authentication, jobs, applications, and user operations using a separate test database.

While the backend runs locally with persistent data, the Heroku deployment uses SQLite, which is ephemeralâ€”meaning data will reset when dynos restart or the app is redeployed. For production use, replacing SQLite with a persistent database like PostgreSQL is recommended. Developers can start the API by installing dependencies, setting environment variables (PORT, JWT_SECRET, and optional DB_PATH), and running npm run dev. The API is designed to integrate cleanly with a React or similar frontend for a complete job board experience.

When the application runs it seeds (automatically creates an admin profile, with username: david and password david123)
