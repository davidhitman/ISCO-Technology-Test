The ISCO Job Board is a complete job posting and application platform built with a Vite + React frontend and a Node.js + Express backend. It allows regular users to register, log in, browse jobs, apply for positions, and track their application statuses, while administrators have extended functionality for managing jobs, applications, and user accounts. Authentication is powered by JWT, with role-based access control determining available features for each user.

On the frontend, the application is structured into distinct, reusable components. Public views like JobsList and JobDetails enable job browsing and detailed viewing, while logged-in users can use ApplyForm to submit applications and MyApplications to track them. Admin-specific views such as AdminJobs and AdminApplications provide tools for creating, updating (including dropdowns for employment type), and deleting job listings, as well as reviewing applications. Navigation is handled by React Router, and authentication state is centrally managed by the custom useAuth hook, which stores JWTs in local storage and decodes them to determine the current user’s role. API communication is abstracted through api.js, which attaches tokens automatically and uses the VITE_API_BASE environment variable to connect to the backend. The frontend is deployed on Vercel.

The backend is a REST API using Express and SQLite for storage. It is divided into route groups: /auth handles registration and login; /jobs manages job postings; /applications handles job applications and status updates; /users manages user accounts. Admin-only routes are protected with middleware, ensuring only authorized users can perform certain actions. All responses are JSON, and pagination/filtering is supported. The database schema—users, jobs, and applications—is automatically initialized on first run, and includes a seeded admin account (username: david, password: david123). While the backend supports persistent storage locally, the Heroku deployment uses SQLite’s ephemeral storage, meaning data resets on dyno restarts; for production, a persistent database like PostgreSQL is recommended. Tests are included with Jest and Supertest.

Together, this stack provides a fully functional job board platform, easily deployable and adaptable. The backend runs on Heroku, the frontend on Vercel, and both communicate securely through authenticated API requests. This separation of concerns ensures scalability, maintainability, and a smooth developer experience.
